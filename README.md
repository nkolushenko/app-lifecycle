# AppLifecycle

**AppLifecycle** is a module for centralized subscription to Unity application lifecycle events.  
It currently supports `OnApplicationFocus` and is easily extensible to other events like `OnApplicationPause`, `OnApplicationQuit`, etc.  
Designed for systems that do not rely on `MonoBehaviour`.
